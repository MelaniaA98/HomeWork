#7. Write a program that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!

a=input("Give a string:")


def longestpalstr(a):
    c=" "
    for i in a:
        for j in range(i[1],len(a)):
            if i==j and i+1==j-1:
                for k in range (i,j):
                    print (k)

b=longestpalstr(a)
